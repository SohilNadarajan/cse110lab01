## Developer

I developed a passion for programming in high school and have grown to love creating code over the last few years. I have created multiple personal projects and have experienced different internships related to software development, exploring what I want to do in the future. Some of my favorite languages to code in include:
1. Java
2. Python
3. C++
I can't wait to dive deeper into software engineering and strengthen my skills as well as build new ones. Feel free to contact me at **sohilgn@gmail.com** or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sohilnadarajan/)!

I created this file with the command `vim index.md`. Check out the [README](README.md)!

## Dancer

I started dancing in my last year of high school and enjoyed it enough to try out for the Bollywood dance team at UCSD. After making the team my first year, dance has grown to be a huge part of me and now I can give back to my team as Finance Captain of UCSD Zor. Our team performs across the nation at different competitions as we try to make our way to nationals. Last year, we went to three comps:
- Aaja Nachle
- Aag Ki Raat
- Jhoomti Shaam

## To Do
